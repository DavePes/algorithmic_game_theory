- Given a payoff matrix and a player's strategy, compute an opponent's best response strategy

## 4) Expected Utility Against a Best Response
- Given a payoff matrix and a player's strategy, compute the expected utility against an opponent's best response strategy

## 5) Finding Dominated Strategies
- Implement a function that finds a set of dominated strategies for a given normal-form game

## 6) Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies
- Implement Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies
